/// Create OAuth client
/// The OAuth Grant/Client is required in order to create an authentication token and gain access to PureCloud.  The preferred authorizedGrantTypes is 'CODE' which requires applications to send a client ID and client secret. This is typically a web server.  If the client is unable to secure the client secret then the 'TOKEN' grant type aka IMPLICIT should be used. This is would be for browser or mobile apps.  If a client is to be used outside of the context of a user then the 'CLIENT-CREDENTIALS' grant may be used. In this case the client must be granted roles  via the 'roleIds' field.
